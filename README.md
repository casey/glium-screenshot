glium-screenshot
================

An example of slow, synchronous screenshot capture.

Will print the average and max frame time in ms in the last 60 frames.

Pressing `S` will cause a screenshot to be captured. (Although not written to disk.)

Screenshot capture is synchronous, so you should notice a larger than average maximum frame time.
